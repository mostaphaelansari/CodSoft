## Projects

### 1. **Credit Card Fraud Detection**
- **Objective**: Build a model to detect fraudulent credit card transactions.
- **Techniques Used**:
  - Algorithms: Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests.
  - Data preprocessing for imbalanced datasets (e.g., SMOTE).
- **Dataset**: [Credit Card Fraud Detection Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kartik2112/fraud-detection).
- **Key Results**: Achieved high precision and recall in identifying fraudulent transactions.

### 2. **Movie Genre Classification**
- **Objective**: Predict the genre of a movie based on its plot summary or textual information.
- **Techniques Used**:
  - TF-IDF for feature extraction.
  - Classifiers: Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines (SVM).
- **Dataset**: [IMDB Genre Classification Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/hijest/genre-classification-dataset-imdb).
- **Key Results**: Successfully classified movies into multiple genres with high accuracy.

### 3. **Spam SMS Detection**
- **Objective**: Classify SMS messages as spam or legitimate.
- **Techniques Used**:
  - TF-IDF for text representation.
  - Classifiers: Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines (SVM).
- **Dataset**: [SMS Spam Collection Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/sms-spam-collection-dataset).
- **Key Results**: Achieved robust spam detection accuracy with minimal false positives.
